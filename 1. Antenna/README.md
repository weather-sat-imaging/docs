# 1. ðŸ“¡â€‹ Antenna

The current antenna, a V-dipole type, is functional but not the best option. Based on recommendations found in the internet and the amateur radio community, we will replace it with a QHA (Quad Helix Antenna) antenna. This antenna is omnidirectional and has a better gain than the V-dipole antenna.

## Requirements

- **Frequency**: 137.5 MHz
- **Lightweight**: to facilitate transport
- **Foldable**: if possible, to facilitate transport

## Antenna specifications

The QHA antenna (Quad Helix Antenna) uses 4 conducting wires arranged in a helix shape. To tune the antenna for the 137.5Mhz frequency band, design parameters should selected carafully.

**TODO :** explain the QHA antenna theory and how to calculate the dimensions
**TODO :** add a link to a QHA antenna calculator
**TODO :** present the selected dimensions and the reasons for this choice
